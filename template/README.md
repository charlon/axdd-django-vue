## Setup

Clone this repo

        $ git clone https://github.com/charlon/new-repo
        $ cd new-repo

## Development (using Docker)

Docker/Docker Compose is used to containerize your local build environment and deploy it to an 'app' container which is exposed to your localhost so you can view your application. Docker Compose creates a 'devtools' container - which is used for local development. Changes made locally are automatically syncd to the 'app' container

        $ docker-compose up

In the case that changes are made to the Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml file, you will need to rebuild the image.

        $ docker-compose up --build

View your application

        Demo: http://localhost:8000/
